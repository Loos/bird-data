# Bird Data Visualization

For a few years, my wife and I have worked with CBCM to rescue birds
that collide into buildings in downtown Chicago during their migrations.
Many of the birds are taken to Willowbrook Wildlife Center, where they
are rehabilitated and released. I asked Willowbrook for the data from
2016 because I was curious about the sheer volume of birds, and if the
data would show different time periods during which different species
migrated, etc. This project exists as a place to store my journey into
the data through visualization tools. It is still an experimental
repository, as I don't know the best framework to use for telling the
story of the birds. Right now I'm trying to do some analysis using
Jupyter Notebook.
